1.0: First release  

1.1: Implemented tab auto-completion for Pixelmon. Previously, pressing tab while typing in the command caused minecraft to  crash.  

1.11: Removed /spawn alias. It was overriding a server-side command to warp back to the server's spawn point.  

1.12: Fixed MimeJr information display. Because the code achieved case-insensitivity by capitalizing the first letter of the pokemon's name and lowercasing the rest, it was searching for "Mimejr" when the J in Jr needed to be capitalized.  

1.2: 
  1) Rewrote a significant amount of the code. Separated biome-related operations into their own class, json parsing operations into their own class, and the pixelmon class is now separate instead of an inner class of the command. Cleaned up the code that parsed the spawn json files a bit and added more comments. Making Pixelmon into its own class should make it easier to develop additional functionality to display pixelmon item drops.
  2) The mod no longer has the minecraft directory hardcoded. Instead, it uses a property to get the location of minecraft game and adds on folders after that. Hopefully this makes it compatible with Technic.  
  
1.21: The mod no longer crashes when it can't find or open the BetterSpawnerConfig or the Pixelmon jar file. Instead, the mod continues. When the command is used or attempts to autocomplete, it attempts to load the BetterSpawnerConfig or Pixelmon file again. If it continues to fail, it displays an error message in chat.  

1.5:
  1) Performed more significant alterations to the code. The BiomeList class no longer exists and its functions and some additional enums were incorporated into an Enums class.
  2) The mod now colors the results! Let me know if it looks horrible - it's easy to change things up.
  3) When looking up a specific pixelmon, the mod now includes percentage chances of encounting that pixelmon. It's not perfect for every set of spawn conditions, but it should give a good idea how rare the pixelmon is in relation to other things that spawn in that biome.
  4) The mod is now capable of taking a set of arguments and returning a list of pixelmon that spawn during all of those conditions, including the percentage chances of encounting them in relation to the other pixelmon returned from the command. The percentage chance will be more inaccurate the more general the tag set. For example, ["Mesa"] will be pretty inaccurate. ["Mesa", "Night", "Land"] will be considerably more accurate. For best results, search directly for your target pixelmon.
  5) The mod now returns various error messages. For example, when sent incompatible tag sets or tags that aren't recognized by the command.

1.5.1: Fixed a problem getting information for Pixelmon that exist in all biomes. Also added code to display an spawn chance for Pixelmon that show up in every biome. It's an averaging of all their spawn chances in all biomes.  

1.5.2: Fixed biomes and percentages being duplicated when a Pixelmon has multiple sets of spawn information. Cosmetic changes.  

1.5.3: Fixed some problems the code was having getting Pixelmon for Mesa (Bryce) biome.  

2.0: 
  1) Added a new command: /drops. This command looks up drops by pixelmon by doing "/drops <pixelmon>" or pixelmon that drop an item by doing "/drops <item_name>".
  2) New mcmod.info stuff, so the mod looks better in the mod info screen, includes both commands in a single mod, and gives credit to the Pixelmon Reforged Dev Team for Pixelmonmod.
  3) Code is over in the Pixelmon_Information_Commands repository now. I learned how Git works so I can actually make proper use of the version control stuff instead of just using this as a file upload site.
  
2.01: Corrected spacing in the spawn info output when the pixelmon has no level range.  

2.02: Added Ho-oh edge case because of the dash. Added additional ways to search for Bryce Mesa. Command returns the usage of the command when using the command without arguments.  
  
2.03: A few cosmetic changes.
  
2.04: Fixed a formatting error when a pixelmon has no level range (like most legendaries).  

2.05: Changed the argument required to search for "Ice Plains Spikes" from ice_spikes_plains to ice_plains_spikes. Fixed the ending parenthesis not properly being added to the list of pixelmon returned when searching by spawn conditions.  

2.1: If you use "/drops" with no argument, the mod checks to see if you're holding an item in your main hand. If you are, it looks up that item instead of displaying the command usage.  
The next change was more significant:  
Before this version, the mod only loaded Pixelmon information for Pixelmon with a JSON file in the spawning folder. This resulted in the inability to look up drops for Pixelmon that do not spawn naturally, such as Machamp. Instead, it give an error saying that it couldn't recognize Machamp as an argument. This has been corrected and now the program loads Pixelmon information for both the JSON files in the spawning folder and the drops.json file. This required the addition of the boolean variable "isNaturallySpawning" for each Pixelmon and some moderate changes to a number of algorithms used to get the information.
Additionally, edge-cases were added for certain Pixelmon that do not spawn naturally, but have structures used to spawn them. Mewtwo, the bird trio, and the creation trio. Whereas most unnaturally-spawning Pixelmon will say they don't naturally spawn, these legendaries will display their level, what object is needed to summon them, and what structure the object needs to be used on.  

2.11: Cosmetic changes.  

2.12: Fixed tab completion crash when hitting tab with just a single space after the command.
